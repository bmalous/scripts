Script compares hashs from clipboard against file hash for MD5, SHA1, SHA224, SHA256, SHA384, SHA512, SHA3-224, SHA3-256, SHA3-384, SHA3-512, BLAKE2b, BLAKE2s, BLAKE3, WHIRLPOOL, RIPEMD, XXHash, CRC32, and Adler32 with Zenity dialogs

# Here's how to set up this hash comparison script as a Thunar custom action:

# Step 1: Install the Script
First, save the script and make it executable:

  sudo cp mini_clip_hash.sh /usr/local/bin/mini_clip_hash
  
  sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/mini_clip_hash

Or save to your personal bin directory
   
  mkdir -p ~/.local/bin

  cp hash_compare.sh ~/.local/bin/mini_clip_hash

  chmod +x ~/.local/bin/mini_clip_hash

# Step 2: Create Thunar Custom Action
1.	Open Thunar and go to Edit â†’ Configure custom actions (or press Ctrl+Shift+C)
2.	Click the "+" button to create a new custom action
3.	Fill in the Basic tab: 
  Name: Compare Hash with Clipboard
  Description: Compare file hash against clipboard hash
  Command: /usr/local/bin/mini_clip_hash %F
  Use ~/.local/bin/mini_clip_hash %F if you installed it locally
4.  Icon: Choose an appropriate icon (optional)
5.	Configure the Appearance Conditions tab:

  File Pattern: * (to match all files)
  
  Appears if selection contains: Select "Regular Files"
  
  Other File Types: Uncheck all boxes
  
  Directories: Uncheck
  
  Audio Files, Image Files, etc.: Check the types you want or leave all checked
  
# Step 3: Test the Setup
1.	Copy a hash to clipboard (e.g., from a website or terminal)
2.	Right-click on a file in Thunar
3.	Select "Compare Hash with Clipboard" from the context menu
4.	View the result in the Zenity dialog
   
Alternative Command Variations
If you want multiple hash comparison options, you can create several custom actions:

For multiple files:

  Command: /usr/local/bin/mini_clip_hash %F
  
  Description: Compare multiple files with clipboard hash
  
For single file with terminal output:

  Command: gnome-terminal -e "/usr/local/bin/mini_clip_hash '%f'"
  
  Description: Compare hash in terminal
  
# Troubleshooting

If the custom action doesn't appear:

  Ensure the script has execute permissions
  
  Check that the path in the command is correct
  
  Verify Thunar is restarted after creating the action
  
If you get "command not found":

  Use the full path to the script
  
  Make sure ~/.local/bin is in your PATH if using that location

# Make sure you have the required tools

Dependencies check:

which zenity xsel xclip md5sum sha256sum

Usage Workflow

1.	Find a file's expected hash (from a website, README, etc.)
   
2.	Copy that hash to your clipboard
   
3.	Right-click the downloaded file in Thunar
   
4.	Select "Compare Hash with Clipboard"
8.	Get instant verification via the popup dialog
This creates a seamless file integrity verification workflow directly from your file manager!
